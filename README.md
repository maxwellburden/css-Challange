# My CSS-Challange

I stared with changing the header to a airstream showing what I like to do in my free time
Changing the coloring scheme to something that would pop out more also something I prefer

# Contact Me
I added my real phone number
I added my real email address
I changed the twitter to my instagram
I linked my github account to it as well

# Work
I added my github link to my run buddy challange we had last week 
I wasnt sure on what the other 2 could be since we are so new into the class so they are just filled spots atm
